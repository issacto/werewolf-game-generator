All players may say anything, but may never show their card to anyone. Werewolves might want to claim to be a different role so that they don't die.\n\nBecause certain roles change other players' cards, some players will believe they are one role, when they are actually a different one. After the night phase, your role is the card that is currently in front of you, which may be different than your original role. No one may look at any cards after the night phase.\n\nAfter a few minutes of discussion, players vote.\n\n3. End of the Game\nAfter just one night and one day...\n\nThe village team wins:\n\nIf at least one Werewolf dies. Even if one or more players who are not Werewolves die in addition to a Werewolf dying, everyone on the village team wins.\n\nIf no one is a Werewolf and no one dies.\n\nIt is possible for no one to be a Werewolf if all Werewolf cards are in the center.\n\nThe werewolf team only wins if at least one player is a Werewolf and no Werewolves are killed.\n\nIf you are playing with the Tanner, there are special rules regarding who wins; see the Tanner's role description for details.\n\n\nReference: https://www.ultraboardgames.com/one-night-ultimate-werewolf/game-rules.php</p> */}\n        </div>\n    )\n}"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
