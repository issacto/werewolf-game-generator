1. Night
There are several roles that are called on at night that are able to perform actions at night. However, those with a Villager, Tanner, or Hunter card are not awoken to perform these actions at night.

In addition to having a role card, one player is designated the Announcer and announces each of the roles in order and silently counts to ten after each role is woken up to allow the players with that role to perform their action at night. Use this script with the previously suggested cards:

2. Day
After the night phase, players discuss among themselves who they believe the Werewolves are. All players may say anything, but may never show their card to anyone. Werewolves might want to claim to be a different role so that they don't die.

Because certain roles change other players' cards, some players will believe they are one role, when they are actually a different one. After the night phase, your role is the card that is currently in front of you, which may be different than your original role. No one may look at any cards after the night phase.

After a few minutes of discussion, players vote.

3. End of the Game
After just one night and one day...

The village team wins:

If at least one Werewolf dies. Even if one or more players who are not Werewolves die in addition to a Werewolf dying, everyone on the village team wins.

If no one is a Werewolf and no one dies.

It is possible for no one to be a Werewolf if all Werewolf cards are in the center.

The werewolf team only wins if at least one player is a Werewolf and no Werewolves are killed.

If you are playing with the Tanner, there are special rules regarding who wins; see the Tanner's role description for details.
